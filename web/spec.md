## how does the pixel canvas interact with the colour picker
The pixel canvas will have 4 buttons underneath. Upon pressing a button the 'chosen colour' changes to that buttons number.  
there is a colour picker constantly on the screen. When you change the colour using the picker all of the pixels get re-painted.  
when you click on a button that has a colour associated with it already, the picker will jump to that colours position.  
## other misc spec
mobile website will have canvas above the wheel picker whilst desktop will have them beside each other canvas left picker right, buttons below canvas.  
the resulting number that corresponds to the image will be shown on the screen too.

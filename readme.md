# 8by8
With this repository you can interact with some 8 by 8 pixel art stuffs in solidity.

### `/web`
If you open the webpage at page.html,  
you can draw your own 8 by 8 pixel arts with up to 4 colours and have them stored in a format that fits in 1 256 bit word.  

This may be useful at some point in the future

### `/src`
`pixelArt.sol` takes an input picture and gives you an svg 
`art.t.sol` verifys that the program works as expected

## Usage
If wanting to work on solidity, download [`forge`](https://github.com.gakonst/foundry) or [`dapp`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools)  
there isn't much of a use yet its just an idea showcase  


### Whats the point?

Maybe something game-related to store the items or the assets on chain.  
Another idea I had was something of a mix between [nifty.ink](https://nifty.ink) and a [nouns](https://nouns.wtf)-like daily auction where each day a blank canvas is sold and then u draw the art for it


## where'd you get this idea / further reading?

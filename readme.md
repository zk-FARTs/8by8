# repo name
with this repository you can interact with some pixel art stuffs in solidity.

### `/web`
if you open the webpage at page.html,  
you can draw your own 8 by 8 pixel arts with up to 4 colours and have them stored in a format that fits in 1 256 bit word.  
this website is really bare bones

### `/src`
pixelArt.sol takes an input picture and gives you an svg 

## Usage
if wanting to work on solidity, download [`forge`](https://github.com.gakonst/foundry) or [`dapp`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools)  
there isn't much of a use yet its just an idea showcase  

if you want to edit the webpage then i suggest just starting from scratch there isn't much there to begin with 

### Whats the point?
I sort of burnt out on this one but i was thinking maybe something game-related to store the items or the assets on chain.  
Another idea I had was something of a mix between nifty.ink and a nouns-like daily auction where each day a blank canvas is sold and then u draw the art for it
